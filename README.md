# Second Hand Clothes App for selling/buying
## Our wonder team : @Eliza-Maria  @izabelaiancu  @Carla-Nicu
### About our project
- Why this project?
It's not hard to notice how exchangeable clothes are especially among young people.
This is a recycling initiative that also helps the enviroment and, why not, the fashion senses.
### Functionalities:
- Login/Sign-up page, each user has its own unique profile.
- Public Dashboard where the user can place his announcements.
- Search bar where you can find others users or search clothes by #hashtags.
- Each user can be both seller or buyer at the same time. No need for different profiles.
### Why our initiative is unique?
- We were inspired by this practice on Instagram and wanted to make it a stand-alone app.
### Possible challanges:
- The time optimisation for searching clothes by tags since there can be many entries for the same tag.
### Utilisation examples:
